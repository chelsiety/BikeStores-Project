## Project Summary

In this project, I created a BikeStores Revenue Analytics Dashboard using a guided project from YouTube, utilizing BikeStores database sourced from SQL Server Tutorial website. I used **SQL Server** to generate a comprehensive dataset from the BikeStores database and performed **JOIN statements** across 8 different tables.

The dataset was imported into **Excel** to create an interactive Excel dashboard with **pivot tables**, charts, and interactive elements. Additionally, a user-friendly **Tableau** dashboard was designed with various **visualizations**, **filters**, and **calculated fields**. The Excel and Tableau dashboards both provide valuable insights into revenue trends, top-performing stores, popular product categories, and top customers. These dashboards enables stakeholders to make informed decisions, optimize sales performance, and refine business strategies.
