# Project Description

In this project, I created a BikeStores Revenue Analytics Dashboard using a guided project from YouTube, utilizing BikeStores database sourced from SQL Server Tutorial website. I used **SQL Server** to generate a comprehensive dataset from the BikeStores database and performed **JOIN statements** across 8 different tables.

The dataset was imported into **Excel** to create an interactive Excel dashboard with **pivot tables**, charts, and interactive elements. Additionally, a user-friendly **Tableau** dashboard was designed with various **visualizations**, **filters**, and **calculated fields**. The Excel and Tableau dashboards both provide valuable insights into revenue trends, top-performing stores, popular product categories, and top customers. These dashboards enables stakeholders to make informed decisions, optimize sales performance, and refine business strategies.

# Project Summary

Revenue Optimization in BikeStores

## Problem Statement

The data analytics project aimed to analyze revenue trends and identify optimization opportunities for BikeStores, a bicycle retail company. The main objectives were to understand revenue patterns across different dimensions, including time, geography, products, stores, brands, and customer segments. Through comprehensive data analysis, the purpose of the project was to provide actionable insights to enhance revenue generation and improve business strategies.

## Key Findings

1.  **Revenue Trends**: The analysis showed a positive revenue trend from 2016 to 2017, reaching a peak of \$3,845,515. However, revenue dropped significantly to \$2,023,989 in 2018, indicating the need to address factors contributing to the decline.

2.  **Monthly Revenue Distribution**: The line chart demonstrated fluctuating revenue throughout the year, with April being the highest revenue month at \$1,350,509, and July having the lowest revenue at \$491,532. Identifying and addressing revenue gaps during off-peak months was seen as a priority.

3.  **Regional Performance**: New York was the highest revenue-generating state, followed by California and Texas. The findings emphasize the potential for targeted strategies to strengthen market presence in other states and achieve a more balanced revenue distribution.

4.  **Store Performance**: Baldwin Bikes stood out as the top-performing store, contributing 67.91% of revenue. Optimizing underperforming stores like Rowlett Bikes presents an opportunity for increased revenue.

5.  **Brand Contributions**: Trek emerged as the leading brand, showcasing its brand strength and popularity among customers. Further efforts can be directed towards promoting other brands to diversify revenue sources.

6.  **Product Category Analysis**: Mountain Bikes and Road Bikes were the highest revenue-generating categories. These top-performing product categories should obtain targeted marketing and promotions for further revenue growth. Consider product enhancements and marketing campaigns for other categories, like Comfort Bicycles and Children Bicycles, in order to unlock untapped revenue potential.

7.  **Top Customers and Sales Representatives Impact**: Top customers like Pamelia Newman and top sales representatives, such as Marcelene Boyer and Venita Daniel, played significant roles in revenue generation. Strengthening relationships with these key stakeholders and supporting moderate and lower performing sales representatives can increase revenue streams.

## Recommendations

1.  **Revenue Stabilization and Growth**: Address the factors contributing to the revenue decline in 2018 through targeted strategies and initiatives to stabilize and enhance revenue growth.

2.  **Seasonal Revenue Optimization**: Implement sales and marketing campaigns during off-peak months to mitigate revenue fluctuations and optimize performance throughout the year.

3.  **Regional Market Expansion**: Leverage success in high-revenue states, New York and California, to strengthen market presence in other states. Explore growth opportunities in other regions to achieve a more balanced revenue distribution.

4.  **Store and Brand Performance**: Analyze and replicate successful strategies from Baldwin Bikes and Trek to optimize other stores and brands' revenue contributions.

5.  **Product Category Enhancement**: Focus on promoting Mountain Bikes and Road Bikes while introducing product enhancements and targeted marketing for other categories.

6.  **Customer and Sales Rep Engagement**: Foster strong relationships with top customers. Recognize and reward top-performing sales reps. Provide support and training to improve moderate and lower performers' sales skills.
